# Napkin

Napkin is a tool for turning UI sketches drawn on napkins, whiteboards, pieces of paper and many other things
into UI layouts.

[![Example of how Napking works in practice](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cYXe-xgM-yw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYXe-xgM-yw)

## How to use it

1. Navigate to https://mjvesa.github.io/napkin-app
2. Choose the camera you want to use
3. Align your sketch so that it is straight and fits in the picture
4. Tap on the image and see that the rectangles have correct tags
5. Tap on generate to create the layout
6. Scroll down to see your layout
7. Tap on share to share the layout as a Unide project

## What is supported, how to draw it

The sketch should be drawn in dark color on white background. The white
background should encompass the entire image. Check the component example
image for all components that are supported. Also, the syntax definition below
gives a more formal treatment. Note that even though the syntax mentions
other layouts, only vertical and horizontal layouts are supported right now
via flexbox.
